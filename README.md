In this project the challenge was to create a country quiz app using an API and fulfill the following user stories:

- I can see at least 2 types of questions: a city is the capital of.. or a flag belong to country..
- I can see select an answer
- I can see if my answer is correct or incorrect
- When I answer correctly, I can move on to the next question
- When I answer incorrectly, I can see my results and try again
- I can try again

Prior to taking on this challenge I had no previous working knowledge of Angular and TypeScript so I used it as a valuable learning experience.

I will continue to further this knowledge by building more projects in which I will also develop the Backend with the main goal of progressing my career as a Web Developer.
